How to use the .jar executable:

Execute "java -jar TP2.jar [input-dir]" on a shell where [input-dir] is the directory that contains the /src/ folder of the project. For example, for the JFreeChart repo, the target directory should be named "jfreechart-master". You can also use a relative directory if the folder that you're evaluating is in the same parent folder as the .jar file.

There is also a .py file that plots the data from the .csv output into graphs for visualization of the results. It doesn't come packaged with an venv so you have to make sure to have the relevant packages installed, and you have to edit the target .csv file to match the path of the output file.
